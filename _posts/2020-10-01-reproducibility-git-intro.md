# Talked about our current issues
- Orian dealing with different versions of scripts. Figuring out Git
- Yanwei dealing with multiple files/threshold to test with GSEA
- An dealing with broken conda environment, cannot install packages

# Talked about the article  [Reproducible Programming for Biologists Who Code. Part 1: Must do](https://ben-heil.github.io/2020-06-16-mustdo/)

## Version control

### Showed the `.snapshot` folder on Whitehead's `corradin_data` (`corradin_biobank` and `corradin_cache` are not backed up)

### War stories
- Created multiple versions of a file and forgetting what they do

- Change one file and don't know if the other files in a pipeline still work or not. Need to test multiple versions of a step in a pipeline

- Inheriting a script from someone else, want to make changes => create different functions `function_x`, `function_x_an`


- Every time create a new feature, duplicate the old file and then add new feature to the new file. Finally, **MANUALLY MERGE BY EYE** to see which line changed between the new file and the old one to copy and paste back into the old file

- The need to maintain two versions of a script concurrently: **development/experiment** and **production**.

- Accidentally delete files and have to rely on backups by IT, which might not be fine-grained enough to save changes between two backups.

- Jupyter froze and did not save code => have to rewrite code


### Introducing git

#### Barebones, layman definition

- `git` is like the `.snapshot` folder storing backup of different versions for you only. `github` is like Google Drive, where you share your code/files with other people. 
  - If you work alone, on the same machine, git is enough
  - If you work alone, on different machines, use git to backup on your local machine, then push to Github
  - If you work with other people, push to Github as above

- Fundamental unit: a `commit`. Committing changes is like saving a checkpoint/version to go back to in video games.

#### 5 "locations" your file goes through

  1. **Stash**: save your changes temporarily in a stack (eg. a change that is not final enough to be a commit). Kind of like `Ctrl + Z`, although you get to define how much work/code is restored each time. You can reapply your changes from the most recent save to the oldest one


  2. **Workspace**: Your active working space, files you create will go here. Files that don't have changes since last commit will go here. Once you added/committed a file, Git tracks the status of that file and tell you (unchanged, uncommitted change)

  3. **Index/Staging area**: Think of it as a loading dock. If your `commit` is like a *shipment*, and your `file changes` are like *individual packages* then your `index/staging area` is where you bundle those changes (could be from one or many different files) into one shipment. 

        Once you have commited the changes/save your check point/sent off the shipment, these changes are always bundled together. Going back to the checkpoint will load changes up until that commit/version 

  4. **Local repository**: Your `.git` folder in the same location that saves all your versions


  5. **Upstream/Remote repository**:  Where you upload your files onto the internet/cloud. This can be Github, Bitbucket, AWS or sites that can store your data for a fee

#### 4 status of file

## Recording data access
- Save the command to download the data (UKBiobank, outside dataset)
- Record the download/access date or version of the dataset
- **How to link data artifact to code?** DVC #future
- **Catalog of data for each project and their metadata** Intake

# Actions for next meeting

  ## Everyone
  - Learn about git commands from the resources below : add, commit, push, merge, branch, checkout, pull 
  - Check out all resources in the **shared** section (they are short, visual and helpful) and one in **optional** section
  
  ## An
  - Design git/github activity (fork, pull request, branch)
  - Prepare more materials on git workflow for data analysis (how often to commit, when to commit etc, branching, visualizing git)
  - Find resources for git + Jupyter, git submodules/changing folder structure
  - Find resources about python package management (conda + pip + Docker)
  - Do nbdev/fastpage tutorial
